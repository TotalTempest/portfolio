            <p>MEMEseum is a fictional brand designed from scratch for a museum that 
                would showcase memes and their origins. The museum would also feature 
                a projected tunnel where visitors can see memes flying around them as 
                they walked through. The brand was designed to be strange, minimalist, 
                and glitchy in order to reflect on the bizarre nature of memes.</p>
