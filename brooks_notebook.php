        <div class="preview-blurb">
            <p>This project is a notebook that is used by Brooks Instrument as part of their marketing material. 
                This notebook was specifically designed to target potential customers in industrial businesses.
                The design is meant to convey the complexity of Brooks Instrument's MFC devices, and to show
                that the company is ready to build effectively and efficiently alongside the customer.
                This was designed primarily with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
