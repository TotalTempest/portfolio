        <div class="preview-blurb">
            <p>A website created for a fictional convention called “Synthfest” that would have featured various music 
                artists from the Synthwave genre and vendors for other products related to the central idea of 80’s 
                futurism. The convention would have been targeted towards fans of 80’s retroism and sci-fi. The site 
                was designed with those two target audiences in mind and blended them together by focusing on 80’s 
                technology and using the conventional synthwave color palette.</p>
