        <h1>Dungeons and Dragons Headquarters</h1>
        <div class="preview-blurb">
            <p>D&D HQ was an app designed to not only help users create a character for the game, 
                but also features a variety of features such as communication between groups, 
                dice rollers, and even tips on how to play the game. The app’s goal was to combine 
                all of the different functions that a user would need for a game of D&D into a 
                single convenient app. The app’s design was made to look a bit medieval, using 
                sword icons and serif fonts. The colors were made to reflect a bit of a “royal” 
                feel while using the main color of the game itself: red.</p>
