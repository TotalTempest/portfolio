        <h1>Cat Smuggling Decoded</h1>
        <div class="preview-blurb">
            <p>This was made as a fictional article instructing people on how to smuggle their 
                cats into their workplace. The guide itself is divided into a 5-step process. 
                The article was designed to look ridiculous and humorous in order to reflect 
                the subject of the article.</p>
