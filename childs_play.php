        <h1>Child's Play Charity Album</h1>
        <div class="preview-blurb">
            <p>Child’s Play is a record album featuring a collection of songs that speak out against violence. 
                The album itself focuses specifically on child soldiers. Real weapons and toy weapons were 
                mixed together in the making of this album’s design to highlight how children and war don’t go together. 
                Most of the typography was made to look like it was exploding like a bomb. The album’s cover 
                title was made using physical spray paint to make it look more natural and messier.</p>
