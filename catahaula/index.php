        <h2>A Little About Us...</h2>
        <p>Catahoula Bar & Restaurant is not your average neighborhood bar.  There’s something special about what we’re doing here. <br><br>
        Our staff is warm and friendly, our chef is always smiling, and we serve the type of food that just makes you feel good.  From classic New Orleans flavors to top notch bar food, we’ve got those taste buds covered.
        <br><br>
        We’ve also got food and drink specials during Phillies, Eagles, Flyers and 76ers games, and there’s not a bad seat in the house with 5 TVs, 2 located outside on our covered patio.
        <br><br>
        So whether you just want to stop by for an Eagles game with a cold Abita draft and one of Philly’s best burgers, or sit down for a belly warming bowl of Acadian Style Gumbo on a cold day, we’ll be happy to see you again.
