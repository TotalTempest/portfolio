            <p>This project is a colorforms set on the story of Balaam and the Talking Donkey 
                from the Bible. It features a magnetic board to place magnets on, and a collection 
                of magnets for each of the different characters at different sizes so children can 
                interact with it. This was designed using a Wacom tablet and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
